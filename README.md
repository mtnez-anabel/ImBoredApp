## About

**I'm bored App** helps you find things to do when you're bored!
This project is an Android application which requests data from the Rest API provided by
the [BoredAPI](https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity) website. You just need to press the button and
you will have a new activity. If the activity has a link, you can tap on it and it will take you to
the website. You can also search in the menu of the *Proposed Activities*, a list of the activities
that have been shown so far.
